# What is a conditional?

A conditional is a method used in coding to make a program execute different lines of code based on whether or not certain criteria are met.

# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

'==' is used in mathematical expressions where '=' would normally be used outside of code, while '=' is reserved for setting/changing the value of a variable.
